            <h1> <b>Storyline</b></h1>
            <h2 id="storyline">
                Your ancestors Were very rich business men. They owned a lot of properties and many bunkers. In one of those bunkers they hid all of their black money ($500Trillion) which they earned using a loophole in the system which no one discovered. One day their accountant, found out about the money and started spending days and nights finding where it was hidden. He finally found out the location. He thought of what all they could do with that money and hired a gangster team to infiltrate the bunker and take all the money. As the gangster leader was a (gangster obviously lol) mastermind, he tricked the accountant and took the money and hid it in a safe house. This place was hidden and the gangsters went greedy never revealing the place and taking of the money every now and then. Your ancestors did grieve about the money but decided never to talk about it so that none of their future family member gets in trouble. But today , after 37 years the truth has been revealed to you when you read one of the ancestorâ€™s diary, you found in the attic that contained all this info. You found the place but little did you know there was a booby trap which activated a timer to a bomb which will set off in 45 minutes and destroy the whole place, it also locked you inside the safe house. Now you need to Find the Money And all the papers that told the secret to their super loop hole to earn money and get out of the house. 
                Good Luck!! May god help you!!
